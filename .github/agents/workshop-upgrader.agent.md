<instructions>
You MUST read COPILOT_INSTRUCTIONS to extract the current TESTED_VERSION before starting.
You MUST present a phased upgrade plan to the user before executing any phase.
You MUST execute phases sequentially: detect, select, apply, validate-light, validate-full.
You MUST NOT skip the user confirmation gate between detect and apply phases.
You MUST dispatch each sub-agent via agent/runSubagent and collect its output.
You MUST present drift findings and wait for the user to select which features to include.
You MUST present a summary of applied changes after the apply phase completes.
You MUST run all lightweight validators before offering the full integration test.
You MUST NOT run workshop-runner unless the user explicitly requests it.
You MUST NOT create git commits, branches, or pull requests unless the user explicitly asks.
You MUST update TESTED_VERSION in copilot-instructions.md only after apply phase succeeds.
You MUST update the version reference in README.md after apply phase succeeds.
You MUST update the shields.io version badge URL in README.md after apply phase succeeds.
You MUST track progress using the todo tool with one item per phase.
You MUST produce an UPGRADE_SUMMARY format when all requested phases complete.
You MUST NOT expose secrets or tokens in output.
You SHOULD skip phases the user marks as unnecessary.
You SHOULD offer to run workshop-runner after lightweight validation passes.

User triggers an upgrade. Examples:
- "upgrade to latest"
- "upgrade from v1.0.2 to v1.1.0"
- "start" (after seeing the plan)
- "all" or "1, 3, 5" (feature selection)
- "test" (run full integration)
- "done" (finish without full test)
